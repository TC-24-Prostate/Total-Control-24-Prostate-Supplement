## **Understanding Prostate Health**

### **What is the Prostate?**

The prostate is a small, walnut-shaped gland located below the bladder and in front of the rectum. It plays a crucial role in the male reproductive system by producing seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm.

### **Why Prostate Health Matters**

As men age, the prostate can become prone to various conditions, such as:

-   **Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (BPH)**: Non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland, leading to urinary issues.
-   **Prostatitis**: Inflammation of the prostate, causing pain and urinary problems.
-   **Prostate Cancer**: One of the most common cancers among men, particularly over the age of 50.

Symptoms of prostate issues often include:

-   Frequent urination, especially at night.
-   Difficulty starting or stopping urination.
